# Preface

Recently, I've been studying some contents of cloud native, etc. Of course, the first one is the configuration of `docker`, `kubernetes` (hereinafter referred to as `k8s`), etc. This article will take **macOS12.3.1** as the main environment, with the architecture of **arm64**(Apple silicon m1), and I will introduce in detail how to configure the **lightweight** cloud native multi-node platform ` K8s` on Mac. The official recommended tool is `minikube`, but it is this software that I finally installed perfectly after a day of searching, debugging and configuring. Be sure to record this historic moment in detail!

It's been almost two years since Apple released m1 chip, but the adaptation of many softwares is still not very good, such as some virtualization programs, ` VirtualBox `, `VMware` and ` HyperKit`. These softwares can't be used as drivers of ` minikube` just because they don't adapt to arm architecture. So here I use ` qemu`, an open source ` x86` simulator with `colima`.

>   I refer many of articles, blogs and github issues from google, medium.github, etc.

# Install docker without docker desktop

Configuration of `K8s` is mainly done through `MiniKube`, and `MiniKube` needs to run in `docker`, which is equivalent to a component of `Docker`. Docker has been configured on my computer before, and it is through a graphical interface, namely `docker desktop`. Although this software is convenient, it takes up a lot of system resources to use. I've always wanted to find a way to **install docker without docker desktop**. The truth is, everything pays off, and many predecessors have written some valuable articles. Here I refer to [^1], [^2].

First of all, of course, you need to use `brew` to install two components of docker. 

```bash
brew install docker
brew install docker-compose
```

At this time, we found that the `docker` installation without graphical interface did not start the service, so we needed an additional virtual machine program called `colima`. We will talk about this later.



# Minikube Complete Configuration Guide

## Install minikube

Of course, it was done by an order, and there was no difficulty.

```bash
brew install minikube
```



If the configuration of minikube is done by the method given in [^1], that is, using `podman` instead of docker, it is necessary to compile minikube manually and attach other configurations, so there is no test here.

## Configure colima virtual machine support (daemon)



There are some configurations here. As mentioned before, docker didn't start the *service*. This is because docker desktop comes with a virtual machine when it is installed (which is directly integrated on Linux), so it can be directly deployed (so again, the resource occupation is relatively large). But when we directly installed `docker` through `brew`, Actually, only the cli(*command-line interface*) of ` docker` is installed. 

If Docker can really run, it needs a virtual machine support, which requires a software called ` colima`. For the specific introduction, please see here [^4]. Before that, I also studied containers such as ` podman`[^3],[^6], but all of them ended in failure when I run `minikube start`...

The configured `colima` environment is a Linux distribution called `alpine` by default. The following is the specific version information on `AlpineLinux`.

```bash
❯ colima start --cpu 2 --memory 2 --disk 10 # config vm with 2GB MEM, 2cores CPU and 10GB disk size
INFO[0000] starting colima
INFO[0000] runtime: docker
INFO[0000] preparing network ...                         context=vm
INFO[0000] starting ...                                  context=vm
INFO[0022] provisioning ...                              context=docker
INFO[0022] starting ...                                  context=docker
INFO[0028] done

❯ colima list
PROFILE    STATUS     ARCH       CPUS    MEMORY    DISK     RUNTIME    ADDRESS
default    Running    aarch64    2       2GiB      10GiB    docker

❯ colima ssh
colima:~$ uname -a
Linux colima 5.10.109-0-virt #1-Alpine SMP Mon, 28 Mar 2022 11:20:52 +0000 aarch64 Linux
colima:~$ cat /proc/version
Linux version 5.10.109-0-virt (buildozer@build-3-14-aarch64) (gcc (Alpine 10.3.1_git20210424) 10.3.1 20210424, GNU ld (GNU Binutils) 2.35.2) #1-Alpine SMP Mon, 28 Mar 2022 11:20:52 +0000
```

As you can see from the configuration process, `colima` is context supported by `docker`, which is also called docker `daemon`.

## Configure docker runtime

With virtual machine support, docker can run **without** `docker desktop`. Here is an example:

>   You should open the configured `colima` virtual machine environment first.

```bash
❯ docker run --rm -d --name nginx -p 8080:80 nginx:latest
1a874a4b15ff5d8f8cbac6dd5ac766067657df0f25328a8765daddceaa1a6ffc
```

And then open your browser, type `localhost:8080`, you can see below interface:

```lua
Welcome to nginx!
If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and working. Further configuration is required.

For online documentation and support please refer to nginx.org.
Commercial support is available at nginx.com.

Thank you for using nginx.
```



## Configure the `kicbase` container of minikube

This is also the most troublesome problem for me, but it is easy to solve. Before, `stderr` [^5] always popped up when `minikube start`, mainly saying that the website `gcr.io` was unreachable. 

```c
Unable to find image 'gcr.io/k8s-minikube/ Kicbase: v0.0.12-Snapshot3 @ sha256: 1D687Ba53E19DBE5FAFE4CC18AA07F269ECC 4B7B62251B5bf569DDB474E9B' locally
```

Later, I thought if I needed to change the image to get it (even if I had hung up the agent), but it didn't work. I searched online and found that there are two versions of this container, `kicbse`. 

On the official homepage of minikube [^10], it shows here that it only supports ` 0.0.17`. In addition, An article mentioned the `x86-only` version (it hasn't been updated for two years [Anjonne/kicbase tags \| Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/Anjonne/kicbase/tags)) ...

The required version when opening minikube by default is ` 0.0.32`, which is the problem. I finally finished downloading this package through docker's official container list [^9] . The command is as follows:

```bash
docker pull kicbase/stable:v0.0.32
```



Note that here, if the speed is slow (If you are in China), you can switch mirrors. By modifying the file ` ~/.docker/daemon.json`, the value of the key  `registry-mirrors` is as follows:

```json
{"experimental":false,"builder":{"gc":{"enabled":true,"defaultKeepStorage":"20GB"}},"features":{"buildkit":true},"registry-mirrors":["https://registry.docker-cn.com"]}
```



## the last config

There is one last problem, which is also mentioned in the issue interface of GitHub [^7], which is an error. The general content is as follows:

```lua
stderr:
W0706 14:21:42.889959    9689 initconfiguration.go:120] Usage of CRI endpoints without URL scheme is deprecated and can cause kubelet errors in the future. Automatically prepending scheme "unix" to the "criSocket" with value "/var/run/cri-dockerd.sock". Please update your configuration!

💡  Suggestion: Check output of 'journalctl -xeu kubelet', try passing --extra-config=kubelet.cgroup-driver=systemd to minikube start
🍿  Related issue: https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/4172
```

This problem can be solved by adding the specified version, thanks to a comment from a GitHub developer[^7].

```bash
minikube start --kubernetes-version=v1.23.8
```



The last command of successfully configuring `minikube` is as follows:

```bash
❯ minikube start --vm-driver=docker --base-image="kicbase/stable:v0.0.32" --image-mirror-country='cn' --image-repository='registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/google_containers' --kubernetes-version=v1.23.8

```

## Close minikube service

It should be noted here that you can't shut down the cluster through `minikube stop`, which will lose the previously created environment and replace it with `minikube pause` and `minikube unpause`, as follows:

```bash
❯ minikube pause
⏸️  Pausing node minikube ...
⏯️  Paused 18 containers in: kube-system, kubernetes-dashboard, storage-gluster, istio-operator

❯ minikube unpause
⏸️  Unpausing node minikube ...
⏸️  Unpaused 18 containers in: kube-system, kubernetes-dashboard, storage-gluster, istio-operator

```

## Check minikube status

```bash
❯ minikube status
minikube
type: Control Plane
host: Running
kubelet: Running
apiserver: Running
kubeconfig: Configured

❯ minikube dashboard
🤔  Checking dashboard in action ...
🚀  Launching proxy ...
🤔  Checking proxy in action ...
🎉  Opening http://127.0.0.1:58190/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/http:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/ in your default browser...

```
`Minikube` dashboard is as follows.

## Check and close docker,colima

```bash
❯ docker ps # check docker process
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                    COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS       PORTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                           NAMES

❯ docker ps

INFO[0001] stopping ...                                  context=vm
INFO[0006] done


```

In this way, every time we use `docker/minikube`, we need to start ` colima` with `colima start`, which is also called the daemon of docker, and then enter ` minikube` with `minikube start` to start container nodes.

# Peroration

With reference to nearly a hundred blog posts, answers from issues and stack overflow, I could say that I have gained a lot. This is my first article in `medium`, if this article has any questions, welcome to point them out. I will be grateful. 

Certainly, if this article helps you, I will be very happy :laughing:~

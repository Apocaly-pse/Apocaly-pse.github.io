## 句子

-   人工智能系统变得越来越精密复杂，我们期待它能够在人类医学和医疗保健领城中得到越来越多的使用。人工智能旨在模仿人的大脑进行决策和学习，计算机可以在几天甚或几小时内完成学可任务，医学人工智能系统在某些任务的完成方面有可能很快超过医生。

    >   As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become more sophisticated, we can expect them to be used more often in the world of human medicine and healthcare. Al is designed to mimic the human brain in decision making and learning, so with the computing power to learn tasks in days or even hours, it is possible to create medical Als that rapidly outperform doctors in certain tasks.

-   医学中使用的大多数人工智能系统都利用了机器学习技术和深度学习技术，采用智能算法，由语音识别、计算机视觉和机器视觉辅助做出决策。

    >   Most of the Al systems working in medicine employ smart algorithms, with the machine and deep learning techniques, and are supplemented by speech recognition and computer or machine vision to make their decisions.

-   在帮助 AI 系统了解人类医学方面，数据发挥着极其重要的作用。通过实际案例中收集的大量数据集，对人工智能系统进行训练，提供大量病人的详细信息是成功的关键因素.

    >   Data plays a hugely important role in helping Al systems learn about human medicine. Al systems are trained on large data sets gathered from real-life cases. Providing detailed patient information in volume is a crucial factor for their success.

-   英国的 100.000 基因组项目提取了军见疾病患者或痉孪患者的约 85,000 个独立基因，并进行了测序。这是目前世界上最大的国家测序项目。研究人员期望所产生的数据将有助于推动未来的诊断技术，并政善癌症的预防和护理。

  >   The UK's 100,000 Genomes Project has sequenced around 85,000 separate genomes from people with rare diseases or cancer. It is currently the largest national sequencing project of its kind in the world. Researchers expect that the data generated will help fuel future diagnostic technologies and improve cancer prevention and care.

-   通过移动的、可穿戴装置应用程序，人们能够共享越来越多的健康数据。使用自然语言处理技术和人工智能虛拟助手或语音助手随时准备按需提供医疗保健.

  >   People are sharing more and more of their health data through apps on mobile and wearable devices. 
  >   Now virtual and voice assistants using natural language processing and Al are being prepped to provide healthcare on-demand.

1.   It will be some time before researchers can develop artificial general intelligence systems capable of abstracting knowledge and developing their own experiences to share with other Als. But firms like Microsoft, Google, Apple, IBM and Facebook are gearing themselves up to deliver the most advanced Al personalized healthcare possible for patients around the world.

     >   研究人员还需要一段时间才能研发出一些人工智能系统，这些人工智能系统能够提取知识并与其他智能系统分享经验。但是微软、谷歌、苹果、IBM 和Facebook公司正在进行调整, 以便为全世界的患者提供最先进的人工智能个性化医疗保健。
2.   One of the most important areas for influencing global health is in the field of epidemiology. 
     Predicting disease outbreaks can save millions of lives by having resources ready should the worst happen.

     >   流行病领域是影响全球健康最重要的领域之一。如果可以预测疾病的爆发，在最糟糕的情况下，也能备好资源以挽救数百万人的生命。
3.   The acceptance of Al in medicine will continue to gather pace in the future as it becomes more widespread. 
     Its promise to enhance patient care by reducing errors in diagnosis, improving the ability to predict disease, and providing assistance to busy clinicians is also the promise of keeping humans at the center of healthcare.

     >   随着人工智能的普及，未来医学领域对人工智能的接受也会加快。有望在滅少诊断错误、提高预测疾病能力方面加强对患者的护理，同时为繁忙的临床医生 提供协助，体现医疗保健以人为本的承诺。
